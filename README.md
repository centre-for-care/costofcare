# Cost of Care

This repository documents our work on calcuating the cost of providing informal care. It takes an intersectional, comparative approach based on the [Individual Synthetic Control Method](https://github.com/giacomovagni/IndividualSyntheticControl) of [Vagni and Breen (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/esr/article/37/5/834/6325498?login=false).
